# Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you create your first AI workflow using Axie Studio. We'll build a simple chatbot that can answer questions about a specific topic.

## Prerequisites

2. Have an OpenAI API key (or another supported LLM provider)

## Step 1: Start Axie Studio

1. Open a terminal
2. Run Axie Studio:
```bash
axie-studio run
```
3. Open http://localhost:7860 in your browser

## Step 2: Create a New Flow

1. Click "Create Flow" in the sidebar
2. Name your flow "Basic Chatbot"

## Step 3: Add Components

1. From the components sidebar, drag these components onto the canvas:
   - ChatInput (from IO section)
   - ChatOpenAI (from Models section)
   - ChatOutput (from IO section)

2. Connect the components:
   - ChatInput → ChatOpenAI
   - ChatOpenAI → ChatOutput

## Step 4: Configure the Model

1. Click on the ChatOpenAI component
2. In the right sidebar:
   - Enter your OpenAI API key
   - Select a model (e.g., "gpt-3.5-turbo")
   - Adjust temperature if desired (0.7 is a good start)

## Step 5: Test Your Flow

1. Click "Build" in the top right
2. In the chat panel:
   - Type a message
   - Press Enter or click Send
   - Watch your flow process the input and generate a response
